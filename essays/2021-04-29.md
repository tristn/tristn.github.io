### Digital Technology through the years
The evolution of digital technology is particularly fascinating for its unceasing exponential growth. Within the first decade of the initial discovery, we can relate its slow growth to naturalization and adoption of these practices. Within the coming decades, refinement of such practices has led us to this new frontier of technological advancements, that we as a human race are starting to lose sight of what we cannot accomplish. Throughout the years, scientists have built upon the foundations of digital design that were laid down from the founders. Each year, we witness the progression and overall evolution of this digital age.

Every year, we toss out what we deem random and worthless. We take the concepts that work, and build upon them. Smoothing out the rough edges and really focusing on building technology to be more efficient, and practical. We see this in many cases, in fact you can look around the room you are standing in and see this at play. Even the device you are reading this on, had been built with this methodology. Take an iPhone for example; Apple really changed the digital industry with their innovative designs. The first generations of the iPhone brought such a clean layout to the phone industry, that it lit up like a wildfire. Each year, improvements are made and Apple refines their product to increase its practicality and ensures they capture the best interest of their audience.

### Creating our Future
As a coding beginner, picking up the design patterns were at first confusing but upon learning the origins and how they were built up it makes sense and i find the convenience of it. When I first learned how to code, I learned Java. I believe most people these days when first trying to pick up coding, will learn in a "simple" language. I was taught various methods of coding style and I never realized the design pattern implemented into the object orientation. Even to this day, I've only recently learned within the last 24 hours what design patterns in coding are and how they have improved my own coding career. Not long ago, humans had to do all computations by hand. We eventually figured out how to use machines to deal with computations when given step by step instruction to follow. Since then, we have built coding languages and styles to further simplify the process for us. The inherent goal is to increase productivity through efficient code. To do this, we build upon last years implementations to create next years innovations.
